# Hamming-classes

Implementation of Hamming codes I used for my university homework.

Classes:

* HammingS - implements the coding and decoding of a given Hamming code
* HammingD - implements the coding and decoding of a given Hamming code with detection of two errors and correction of one error
* HammingC - implements the coding and decoding of a given cyclical Hamming code
